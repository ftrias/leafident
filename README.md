----------

This project attempts to identify tree species form images of leaves. It uses
the Leafsnap dataset to train a MobileNet workwork. The training is implemented
in Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV.

## Training

First, look at the `leaf-setup.ipynb` notebook to see how to download the Leafsnap
data and preprocess the images for training.

Next run `run.sh`, which will train both the CNN and MobileNet models.

The notebook `tests.ipynb` is used to explore and validate the resulting models.

## Results

`CNN.log` and `MNET.log` provide the output of my two training runs.
